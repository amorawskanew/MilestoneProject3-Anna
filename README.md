1.PROJECT'S NAME: Cocktail Collections

This application allows users to add their favorite cocktail recipie, edit, update or delete it. 
It also has a section with top bartenders and links for best bars in the world.

2.UX
The purpose of this app is to  provide platform for cocktail lovers, so they cvan share 
their favorite cocktail recipies as well as to provide some interesting information on bars and bartenders. 

3.DATABASE
Thge datata base of cocktail recipies was built based on IBA ( International Bartenders Association) and is stored in Mongo DB in a form of twwo collections: "categories" and "coctails" 

4.FEATURES

A. HOME PAGE
B. ALL COCKTAILS
C. ADD NEW COCKTAIL
D. STARS

Home page is my landing page where I briefly explain the purpose of the app and show different cocktail categories. 
They are as follow:
    *Classics
    *New era drinks
    *Specials
    *Beer cocktails
    *Wine cocktails
    *Liquor coctails
    *Flaming drinks
    *Non-alcoholic drinks
    *Excentric

When you click on one of the cocktail categories ON HOME PAGE, you get displayed a collection of cocktails that belong to that category. Here you can choose your favorite cocktail and go to this cocktail recipie page by clicking on the button "VIEW COCKTAIL"
You can also access a cocktail of your choice via ALL COCKTAILS, where all the cocktails are displayed.
I have also added a page STARS where you can get familliar with some of the top cocktail creaters in the industry. 

4.USED TECHNOLOGIES:

HTML - used for building the framework of the project.
CSS- used for styling some components of the app.
PYTHON-languageto was used to create the functions that render the cocktail categories or cocktails  
FLASK- framework was used to route python functions and link to the html pages.
MATERIALIZE CSS- the main framework used to build the responsive front-end design of the website.
JQuery was used to initialise the Materialize CSS framework.
Google Fonts used as main fonts on website.
MongoDB Atlas is the database used to store cocktail collections.
GitPodto- used to write my code
GitHub used as a repository of the app.
Heroku- used for the deployment of the app

5.TESTING- I tested every component of my app as I was building it: Navigation bar, Footer, CRUD functionalities,checking if all the elements work properly. I tested every page on different devices: iphone, ipad, desktop .
Also, I checked its functional aspect by asking firiends to add a recipie and observed how long it takes to load the pagre.

*Testing Tools
"inspect" from  Development Tools.
Validator check the code ( HTML, CSS) 


6.DIFFICULTIERS:
 I had some issues with loading my css file. Sometimes it didn't show the modifications I applied to a page and had to "hard reload" quite often. 
 Some of the CSS styling is placed within showcoctail.html file as it didnt work when moved to style.css


7.THINGS I AM HAPPY ABOUT:

I am definitely happy I kept my project simle, which helped me focus on pracrticing implementation of CRUD technologies. Before starting the project, I went through 
most nof the Code institute tutorial videos again to made sure I know what and why I want to use. Also, my mentor and slack community was wery helpful as they guided me through 
the brainstorming part of the project, which was the most challenging for me. Once the wireframe was in place I was able to to work on it mostly independently.

8.USED MATERIALS
*Code Institute video tutorials 
*Youtube videos -mainly for styling cards and making images responsive
eg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yLcgKxBRVg&t=1078s
*Materialize website
*Google icons
*StuckOverflow website
*Various online tutorials and documentation on python
*W3 Shools.com page for CSS styling
*Tutor online support 

Navbar, Footer and cards code were taken from Materialize, but they are very similar to those from the Code Institute tutorial videos.
Code for the cards for the landing page were taken from Youtube video "How to create Simple & Responsive Cards using Materialize CSS".
The main code for add cocktail was taken from Code institute tutorial ,modified and ajusted to my apps requiements.

The photos used in this site were obtained from multiples blogs/articles/webs about recipies, bartending and mixology
