4.USED TECHNOLOGIES:

HTML - used for building the framework of the project.
CSS- used for styling some components of the app.
PYTHON-languageto was used to create the functions that render the cocktail categories or cocktails  
FLASK- framework was used to route python functions and link to the html pages.
MATERIALIZE CSS- the main framework used to build the responsive front-end design of the website.

JQuery was used to initialise the Materialize CSS framework.
Google Fonts used as main fonts on website.
MongoDB Atlas is the database used to store the music library.

Python was used to build the functions that rendered the songs from the mongodb database.
python-dotenv was used to store configuration in the .env file and add them to the environment variables, separate from my code.

GitPodto- used to write my code
GitHub used as a repository of the app.
Heroku- used for the deployment of the app

TESTING- I tested every component of my app as I was building it: Navigation bar, Footer, CRUD functionalities,checking if all the elements are responsive 
and look presentable on every device. Tested its functional aspect by asking firnds to add a recipie and tried to observed how long it takes to load the pagre.
While testing I utested a lot using "inspect" from  Development Tools., sometimes check the code ( HTML, CSS) using Validators.
I kept constamtly checking, reading error messages and testing different solutions untill I got it right. Initially, I had some problem with deployment 
to Heroku as my configuration Vars were not set correctly.

Project was constantly tested via "inspect". I had some issues with loading my css file. Sometimes it didn't show the modifications I applied to a page and 
had to rely on "Hard reload" quite often. 

DIFFICULTIERS:





WWHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY IF I COULKD START IT OVER AGAIN;



THINGS I AM HAPPY ABOUT:

I am definitely happy I kept my project simle, which helped me focus on pracrticing implementation of CRUD technologies. Before starting the project, I went through 
most nof the tutorial videos again to make sure I know what and why I want to use. Also, my mentor and Slack community was wery helpful as they guided me through 
the brainstorming part of the project, which was the most challenging for me. Once the wireframe was in place I was able to to work on it mostly independently.
